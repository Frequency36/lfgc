            Yes, let's rejoice
            <br>For the king is born
            <br>Come on, lift your voice
            <br>
            <br>A King is born this day in Bethlehem
            <br>Hallelujah
            <br>No crown is worn but angels worship Him
            <br>Halle-hallelujah
            <br>Almighty God, so meek, so mild
            <br>Salvation comes through this holy Child
            <br>
            <br>A King is born (He is in the manger now)
            <br>A King is born (humbly come and humbly bow)
            <br>The tiny boy (reaching out a tiny hand)
            <br>A King is born this day in Bethlehem
            <br>
            <br>Yes
            <br>
            <br>His palace is lowly, His throne is made of hay
            <br>Hallelujah (hallelujah)
            <br>Shepherds bow down to see His holy face
            <br>Halle-hallelujah
            <br>Heaven is singing of peace on earth
            <br>Filled with the wonder of this birth
            <br>
            <br>A King is born (He is in the manger now)
            <br>A King is born (humbly come and humbly bow)
            <br>The tiny boy (reaching out a tiny, tiny hand)
            <br>A King is born this day in Bethlehem
            <br>
            <br>Come on, clap your hands with it
            <br>
            <br>Come humbly and humbly bow
            <br>He's in the manger now
            <br>Come humbly and humbly bow
            <br>He's in the manger now
            <br>Come humbly and humbly bow
            <br>He's in the manger now
            <br>Come humbly and humbly bow
            <br>He's in the manger now
            <br>
            <br>A King is born this day in Bethlehem (a King is born, is born)
            <br>Hallelujah (hallelujah)
            <br>No crown is worn but angels worship Him
            <br>Halle-hallelujah
            <br>Almighty God, so meek, so mild
            <br>Salvation comes through this holy Child
            <br>
            <br>A King is born (everybody praise His name)
            <br>A King is born (we will never be the same)
            <br>The tiny Lord (reached out His mighty hand)
            <br>A King is born this day in Bethlehem
            <br>
            <br>A King is born (we will never, never be the same)
            <br>A tiny Lord (reached out His Mighty hand)
            <br>A King is born this day in Bethlehem
            <br>
            <br>This day in Bethlehem
            <br>This day in Bethlehem
            <br>
            <br>Praise the lord, yes
            <br>Praise the lord
            <br>Well, that baby grew up
            <br>He grew up to become the saviour of the world
            <br>Who gave us life and taught us how to live
